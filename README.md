# Crypto Trackr â€“ Team Doge

This project was developed for Cal Poly's CS307 by Jin Choi, Tessa Tapmongkol, Hadi Asemi, and Wesly Ortega. 

It was developed using a React frontend and a Flask backend.

The web app's main purpose is to allow for the searching and tracking of cryptocurrency prices. Users are able to create an account that allows them to search for a specific cryptocurrency and add them into an individual watchlist. The watchlist can be arranged in any way that the user sees fit.

## Installation
Detailed instructions on how to set up the frontend and backend can be found in their respective folders. The general requirements are to have pip (or any package manager) and npm installed.
