# Crypto Trackr â€“ Team Doge

This project was developed for Cal Poly's CS307 by Jin Choi, Tessa Tapmongkol, Hadi Asemi, and Wesly Ortega. 

It was developed using a React frontend and a Flask backend. The web app's main purpose is to allow for the searching and tracking of cryptocurrency prices. 

Users are able to create an account or login onto an existing account.

Once in their accounts, users are able to search for a specific cryptocurrency and add them into their watchlist. The watchlist can be arranged in any way that the user sees fit.
