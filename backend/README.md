## Dependencies
Some libraries need to be installed in order to be able to run backend.
To install them, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Style Checking
To check that you are following the PEP8 style formatting guide, run
`pycodestyle <filename>`. To solve minor styling issues, you can also run
`autopep8 --in-place -a -a <file>`. Note that this does NOT remove all styling errors. 
You will have to re-run the stylechecker afterwards to make sure that all issues were addressed.

More info about the PEP8 Style Guide can be found at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

## Database URI
The URI for the database has been hidden. You will need this in order to be able to connect to the database.
The URI is available in the backend channel of the server under the pinned messages.
Any questions, contact Wes
